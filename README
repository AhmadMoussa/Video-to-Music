Small pet project that is supposed to ultimately enable midi generation from a video stream:

Using:
  - OpenCV
  - Python
  ... more to come
  
First commit summary:
  created python script that takes a videostream and detects a color in it using openCV by creating a mask on top of it
  
 Future:
  Divide video frames into smaller cells
  Use these cell to detect an activation of color
  If activation positive, send a signal
  Assign cells to midi notes
  Quantize these notes
  Return a midi stream
